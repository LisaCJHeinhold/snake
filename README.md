# Overview

This is my first ever game. I figured for a good game for my first time would be the classic Snake game. I wanted to use pygame for this project, because I already have a basis in python.

To play the game run "py snake.py". Then the point is to get the green snake to eat the red food. Use your arrow keys to control the direction your snake goes. Each food you eat adds a point and makes your snake longer. Avoid hitting the edges because you will be sent to the other side of the screen. 
Good Luck!

# Development Environment

To make this game I used python, with pygame. I used random to randomize the food and snake starting point.

# Useful Websites

* [PyGame Docs](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)
* [Replit Snake Game Docs](https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/python/build-snake-with-pygame)

# Future Work

* I think it could be fun to spice the game up and add more than one food at a time that are worth different points, or have a time limit on them.
